# Shunt Impedance

Shunt impedances attach to a single bus and have a voltage-dependent admittance.

For shunt impedances the power consumption is given by $s_i = |V_i|^2 y_i^*$ so that $p_i + j q_i = |V_i|^2 (g_i -jb_i)$. However the p and q below are defined directly proportional to g and b $p = |V|^2g$ and $q = |V|^2b$, thus if $p>0$ the shunt impedance is consuming active power from the bus and if $q>0$ it is supplying reactive power (i.e. behaving like an capacitor).
