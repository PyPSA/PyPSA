# Load

The load attaches to a single bus and consumes power as a PQ load. It can also be used to model other loads than power, such as hydrogen or heat.

For loads, if $p>0$ the load is consuming active power from the bus and if $q>0$ it is consuming reactive power (i.e. behaving like an inductor).
