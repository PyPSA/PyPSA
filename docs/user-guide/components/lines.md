# Line

Lines represent transmission and distribution lines. They connect a `bus0` to a `bus1`. They can connect either AC buses or DC buses. Power flow through lines is not directly controllable, but is determined passively by their impedances and the nodal power imbalances according to Kirchhoff's voltage law. To see how the impedances are used in the power flow, see [line-model](#line-model).
