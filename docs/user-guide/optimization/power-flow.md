# Linearised Power Flow

## Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)

The Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) mandates that the sum of power flows into a
bus must equal the sum of power flows out of the bus at each time step. It is
covered by the more general [Energy Balance](energy-balance.md) constraints
which is also applied to non-electric buses. For electric buses, KCL is the
specific form of the energy balance constraint.

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

For lines and transformers, whose power flows according the impedances, the
power flow $p_{l,t}$ in AC networks is governed by the cycle-based linearised formulation
of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

$$\sum_l C_{l,c} x_l p_{l,t} = 0  \quad \forall\, c,t$$

where  $C$ is a [cycle basis
matrix](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.cycle_basis.html)
of the network graph, where the independent cycles $c$ are expressed as directed
linear combinations of lines $l$, and $x_l$ is the series reactance.

While there are different formulations of KVL, the cycle-based formulation was
found to be substantially faster than other formulations due to its sparsity, as
shown in Hörsch et al. (2018)[^1]. This formulation defines the same feasible
space as other standard linearised formulations based on voltage angles that is
commonly found in textbooks (B-Theta) or the formulation based on Power Transfer
Distribution Factors (PTDFs).

These constraints are set in the function `define_kirchhoff_voltage_constraints()` and carry the name `Kirchhoff-Voltage-Law`.

!!! tip "Tip: KVL with DC networks"

    For DC networks, replace the series reactance $x_l$ by the series resistance $r_l$.

!!! note "Note: Retrieving the PTDF matrix"

    The PTDF matrix of sub-networks (i.e. synchronous zones) can be calculated with [`sn.calculate_PTDF()`][pypsa.networks.SubNetwork.calculate_PTDF] method.

!!! tip "Tip: Using the [`Link`](/api/components/types/links) component for Net Transfer Capacities (NTCs)"

    For simplified transmission representation using Net Transfer Capacities (NTCs), use the [`Link`](/api/components/types/links) component with controllable power flow like a transport model. The [`Link`](/api/components/types/links) component can also be used to represent a point-to-point HVDC link.

!!! note "Note: Handling impedance changes with transmission expansion"

    If $F_l$ is also subject to optimisation (`s_nom_extendable=True`), the impedance $x$ of the line is **not** automatically changed with the capacity (e.g. to represent added parallel lines).
    However, the extension [`n.optimize.optimize_transmission_expansion_iteratively()`][pypsa.optimization.OptimizationAccessor.optimize_transmission_expansion_iteratively] covers this through an
    iterative process as done Hagspiel et al. (2014)[^2] .


## Loss Approximation

The AC transmission losses $\psi_{l,t}$ are approximated using a tangent-based linearization of the loss parabola:

$$
\psi_{l,t} = r_{l} p_{l,t}^2
$$

where $r_l$ is the resistance, following Neumann et al. (2022)[^3].

The approximation uses piecewise linear constraints:

$$
0 \leq \psi_{l,t} \leq r_{l} (\bar{p}_{l,t} \overline{P}_{l})^2 \quad \forall l,t
$$

$$
\psi_{l,t} \geq m_k \cdot p_{l,t} + a_k \quad \forall l,t,\ k = 1, \dots, n
$$

$$
\psi_{l,t} \geq -m_k \cdot p_{l,t} + a_k \quad \forall l,t,\ k = 1, \dots, n
$$

For each segment $k$ of the total $n$ segments, the slope $m_k$ and offset $a_k$ are derived as:

$$
\psi_{l,t}(k) = r_{l} \left(\frac{k}{n} \cdot \bar{p}_{l,t} \overline{P}_{l}) \right)^2
$$

$$
m_k = \frac{d \psi_{l,t}(k)}{dk} = 2 r_{l} \left(\frac{k}{n} \cdot \bar{p}_{l,t} \overline{P}_{l} \right)
$$

$$
a_k = \psi_{l,t}(k) - m_k \left(\frac{k}{n} \cdot \bar{p}_{l,t} \overline{P}_{l} \right)
$$

The losses also modify the [power balance](energy-balance.md) by adding the term to its left-hand side

$$
-0.5 \cdot \sum_{l} |K_{n,l}| \cdot \psi_{l,t} \quad \forall n,t
$$

splitting losses equally between both connection points.

The dispatch limits of $p_{\ell,t}$ are now subtracted by $\psi_{l,t}$.

These constraints are set in the function `define_loss_constraints()`.

The transmission loss approximation is not activated by default, but must be
enabled by providing a number of tangents in [`n.optimize()`][pypsa.optimization.OptimizationAccessor.__call__].

```python
n.optimize(transmission_losses=3)
```

The higher the number of tangents, the more accurate the approximation, but also
the more constraints are added to the optimisation problem. Typically, 2-4
tangents are sufficient for a reasonably accurate approximation.

!!! hint "Hint: Calculating transmission losses"

    The losses can be calculated with `n.lines_t.p0 + n.lines_t.p1`.
