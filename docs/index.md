PyPSA stands for "Python for Power System Analysis". It is pronounced "pipes-ah".

PyPSA is an open source toolbox for simulating and optimising modern power and
energy systems that include features such as conventional generators with unit
commitment, variable wind and solar generation, storage units, coupling to other
energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. PyPSA is
designed to scale well with large networks and long time series.

This project is maintained by the [Department of Digital Transformation in
Energy Systems](https://tub-ensys.github.io) at the [Technical University of
Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin). Previous versions were developed by the Energy
System Modelling group at the [Institute for Automation and Applied
Informatics](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php) at the [Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) funded by the
[Helmholtz Association](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/), and by the [Renewable
Energy
Group](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/renewable-energy-system-and-network-analysis/)
at [FIAS](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/) to carry out simulations for the
[CoNDyNet project](https://fias.institute/en/projects/condynet/), financed by the [German Federal
Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/)
as part of the [Stromnetze Research
Initiative](http://forschung-stromnetze.info/projekte/grundlagen-und-konzepte-fuer-effiziente-dezentrale-stromnetze/).
