    "\n",
    "While we explored the use of `n.optimize.optimize_mga()` in the previous example, PyPSA includes a few additional functions making it convenient to work with near-optimal spaces in a geometric way. While the `optimize_mga` function solves a network with an alternative objective function (given by the `weights` argument), `n.optimize_mga_in_direction` is a simple alternative useful for exploring trade-offs between multiple alternative objectives. It takes two key arguments: a dictionary of `dimensions`, specifying multiple alternative objectives in the same format as the previously mentioned `weights`, and a `direction` representing a vector in the coordinate space defined by `dimensions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we explore the trade-offs between wind and solar expansion in a simple renewables-based system. Therefore, we define our `dimensions` (or alternative objectives) as total installed wind capacity and total installed solar capacity in MW, respectively. These dimensions can also be seen as defining a projection of near-optimal space of the model down to two dimensions.\n",
