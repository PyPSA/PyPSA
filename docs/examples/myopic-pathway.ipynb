    "# Myopic Pathway Planning\n",

    "In this example, we demonstrate how to use PyPSA to plan a myopic pathway for emission reductions. That means that we optimize the system for each investment period sequentially subject to set emission reduction targets per period. In consequence, the model does not foresee future costs or benefits of investments. This is in contrast to a [pathway optimisation with perfect foresight](), where the model optimizes the system for all investment periods at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we build a model from the [single-node capacity expansion example]() and model a myopic decision process for the investment periods 2025, 2035, and 2045. The model is set up to reduce emissions from 30 MtCO2/a in 2025 to 10 MtCO2/a in 2035 and 3 MtCO2/a in 2045. Note that the goal here is not necessarily to showcase a realistic scenario, but rather to demonstrate how it is possible to model a myopic decision process in PyPSA."
