    "## Perfectly inelastic demand up to VOLL\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid the price spikes is to model demand as perfectly inelastic up to a predefined value of lost load (VOLL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively, this is defined by a utility function $U(d) = Vd$ with a constant value $V$ for consumption $d\\in[0,D]$, for instance 1000 €/MWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "In electricity market models, utility generally represents the willingness to pay that consumers obtain from consuming electricity. Formally, utility is a function $U(d)$ of demand $d$. Its key property is that its derivative equals the (inverse) demand curve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial U(d)}{\\partial d} = p(d)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p(d)$ is the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for the marginal unit of electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the demand curve is a step function. It is perfectly inelastic up to a price of $V$ at which point it is perfectly elastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we make the substitution $d=D-g$ (where $g$ denotes the unserved demand), we see that we can model the VOLL case with a load shedding generator with marginal costs of $V=1000$ €/MWh, omitting the term $VD$ as it is a constant and does not affect optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "$U(d) = Vd$\n",
    "\n",
    "$U(d) = VD - Vg$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the objective sense of PyPSA is to minimize costs in order to maximize utility, so any costs have a positive sign and utility gains have a negative sign in the objective.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we add a load-shedding generator with marginal cost $V$ and capacity to meet the maximum demand $D$ (here ```p_nom=100``` as $D=100$ MW). When the load shedding generator produces 1 unit, it means that 1 unit of demand is not met. Because it has a marginal cost of $V$, the optimizer will only activate it when all available generating options are more expensive than $V$, or when there is not enough physical capacity to meet demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If supply becomes insufficient, the model dispatches load shedding at cost $V$, and the market price increases up to exactly $V$. Thus, VOLL acts as an upper bound on market prices and ensures feasibility by allowing controlled load shedding instead of forcing the model to meet demand at arbitrarily high cost."
