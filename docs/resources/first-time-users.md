# First Time Users

If it is your first time with Python, we recommend `conda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_, `mamba
<https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_ or `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ as easy-to-use package managers. They are
available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

It is always helpful to use dedicated `conda/mamba environments <https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html>`_ or `virtual environments
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_.
