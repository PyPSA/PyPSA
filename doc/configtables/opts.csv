``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``, Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots, ``prepare_network``: `average_every_nhours() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L110>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L146>`__), In active use
``nSEG``; e.g. ``4380SEG``, "Apply time series segmentation with `tsam <https://tsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package to ``n`` adjacent snapshots of varying lengths based on capacity factors of varying renewables, hydro inflow and load.", ``prepare_network``: apply_time_segmentation(), In active use
``Co2L``, Add an overall absolute carbon-dioxide emissions limit configured in ``electricity: co2limit``. If a float is appended an overall emission limit relative to the emission level given in ``electricity: co2base`` is added (e.g. ``Co2L0.05`` limits emissisions to 5% of what is given in ``electricity: co2base``), ``prepare_network``: `add_co2limit() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L19>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L154>`__, In active use
``Ep``, Add cost for a carbon-dioxide price configured in ``costs: emission_prices: co2`` to ``marginal_cost`` of generators (other emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` possible as well), ``prepare_network``: `add_emission_prices() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L24>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L158>`__, In active use
``CCL``, Add minimum and maximum levels of generator nominal capacity per carrier for individual countries. These can be specified in the file linked at ``electricity: agg_p_nom_limits`` in the configuration. File defaults to ``data/agg_p_nom_minmax.csv``., ``solve_network``, In active use
``EQ``, "Require each country or node to on average produce a minimal share of its total consumption itself. Example: ``EQ0.5c`` demands each country to produce on average at least 50% of its consumption; ``EQ0.5`` demands each node to produce on average at least 50% of its consumption.", ``solve_network``, In active use
``ATK``, "Require each node to be autarkic. Example: ``ATK`` removes all lines and links. ``ATKc`` removes all cross-border lines and links.", ``prepare_network``, In active use
``BAU``, Add a per-``carrier`` minimal overall capacity; i.e. at least ``40GW`` of ``OCGT`` in Europe; configured in ``electricity: BAU_mincapacities``, ``solve_network``: `add_opts_constraints() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/solve_network.py#L66>`__, Untested
``SAFE``, Add a capacity reserve margin of a certain fraction above the peak demand to which renewable generators and storage do *not* contribute. Ignores network., ``solve_network`` `add_opts_constraints() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/solve_network.py#L73>`__, Untested
``carrier+{c|p}factor``, "Alter the capital cost (``c``) or installable potential (``p``) of a carrier by a factor. Example: ``solar+c0.5`` reduces the capital cost of solar to 50\% of original values.", ``prepare_network``, In active use
