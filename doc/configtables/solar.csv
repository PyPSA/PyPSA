,Unit,Values,Description
cutout,--,"One of {'europe-2013-era5', 'europe-2013-sarah'}","Specifies the directory where the relevant weather data ist stored that is specified at ``atlite/cutouts`` configuration. Both ``sarah`` and ``era5`` work."
resource,,,
-- method,--,"Must be 'pv'","A superordinate technology type."
-- panel,--,"One of {'Csi', 'CdTe', 'KANENA'} as defined in `atlite <https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite/tree/master/atlite/resources/solarpanel>`_","Specifies the solar panel technology and its characteristic attributes."
-- orientation,,,
-- -- slope,°,"Realistically any angle in [0., 90.]","Specifies the tilt angle (or slope) of the solar panel. A slope of zero corresponds to the face of the panel aiming directly overhead. A positive tilt angle steers the panel towards the equator."
-- -- azimuth,°,"Any angle in [0., 360.]","Specifies the `azimuth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth>`_ orientation of the solar panel. South corresponds to 180.°."
capacity_per_sqkm,:math:`MW/km^2`,float,"Allowable density of solar panel placement."
correction_factor,--,float,"A correction factor for the capacity factor (availability) time series."
corine,--,"Any subset of the `CORINE Land Cover code list <http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/corine-land-cover-2006-raster-1/corine-land-cover-classes-and/clc_legend.csv/at_download/file>`_","Specifies areas according to CORINE Land Cover codes which are generally eligible for solar panel placement."
natura,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to exclude `Natura 2000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natura_2000>`_ natural protection areas. Area is excluded if ``true``."
potential,--,"One of {'simple', 'conservative'}","Method to compute the maximal installable potential for a node; confer :ref:`renewableprofiles`"
clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,"To avoid too small values in the renewables` per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero."
