name,required,False,str,True,,,Unique name
bus0,required,False,str,True,,,Name of first bus (typically higher voltage) to which transformer is attached.
bus1,required,False,str,True,,,Name of second bus (typically lower voltage) to which transformer is attached.
type,configurable,False,str,True,,,"Name of 2-winding transformer standard type. If this is not an empty string """", then the transformer type impedance parameters are taken from the standard type along with ""num_parallel"". This will override any values set in r, x, g, b, s_nom, tap_ratio, tap_side and phase_shift. If the string is empty, PyPSA will simply read r, x, etc."

num_parallel,configurable,False,float,True,,1.0,"When ""type"" is set, this is the number of parallel transformers (can also be fractional). If ""type"" is empty """" this value is ignored."
tap_ratio,configurable,False,float,True,per unit,1.0,Ratio of per unit voltages at each bus for tap changed.  Ignored if type defined.
tap_side,configurable,False,int,True,,0,"Defines if tap changer is modelled at the primary 0 side (usually high-voltage) or the secondary 1 side (usually low voltage) (must be 0 or 1, defaults to 0). Ignored if type defined."
