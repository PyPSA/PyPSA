SubNetwork,sub_networks,"Subsets of buses and passive branches (i.e. lines and transformers) that are connected (i.e. synchronous areas)."
Bus,buses,"Electrically fundamental node where x-port objects attach."
Carrier,carriers,"Energy carrier, such as AC, DC, heat, wind, PV or coal. Buses have direct carriers and Generators indicate their primary energy carriers.  The Carrier can track properties relevant for global constraints, such as CO2 emissions."
GlobalConstraint,global_constraints,"Constraints for OPF that affect many components, such as CO2 emission constraints."
Line,lines,"Lines include distribution and transmission lines, overhead lines and cables.",passive_branch
LineType,line_types,"Standard line types with per length values for impedances.",standard_type
Transformer,transformers,"2-winding transformer.",passive_branch
TransformerType,transformer_types,"Standard 2-winding transformer types.",standard_type
Link,links,"Link between two buses with controllable active power - can be used for a transport power flow model OR as a simplified version of point-to-point DC connection OR as a lossy energy converter. NB: for a lossless bi-directional HVDC or transport link, set p_min_pu = -1 and efficiency = 1. NB: It is assumed that the links neither produce nor consume reactive power.",controllable_branch
