snapshots,list or pandas.Index,n/a,"[""now""]","List of snapshots or time steps. All time-dependent series quantities are indexed by ``network.snapshots``. To reset the snapshots, call ``network.set_snapshots(new)``.",Input (optional)
snapshot_weightings,pandas.DataFrame, hours ,1,"The weightings applied to each snapshot, so that snapshots can represent more than one hour or fractions of one hour. The objective weightings are used to weight snapshots in the LOPF objective function. The store weightings determine the state of charge change for stores and storage units. The generator weightings are used when calculating global constraints.",Input (optional)
investment_periods,pandas.Index,years,[],"Time periods of investment. Only used for multi investment optimisation. Years have to be integer and increasing (e.g. [2025,2030,2035]). Default is an empty pd.Index([]).",Input (optional)
investment_period_weightings,pandas.DataFrame,n/a,1,Weightings applied to each investment period. Objective weightings are multiplied with all cost coefficients in the objective function of the respective investment period (e.g. used to include social discount rate). Years weighting denote the elapsed time until the subsequent investment period (e.g. used for global constraints CO2 emissions).,Input (optional)
