        """Run MGA optimization in multiple directions in parallel.

        This method performs modelling-to-generate-alternatives (MGA) optimization
        across multiple directions simultaneously using parallel processing. Each
        direction represents a different objective in the low-dimensional projection
        space defined by the dimensions parameter.

        Note that, in order to achieve parallelism, this method exports the network
        to a temporary NetCDF file which is then re-imported in each parallel process.
        This leads to a slight overhead in IO and disk space. The temporary file is
        always cleaned up after the optimization is complete, regardless of whether
        any errors occurred during the optimization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        directions : list[dict] | pd.DataFrame
            Multiple directions in the low-dimensional space. If a list, each element
            should be a dictionary with keys matching those in `dimensions` and values
            representing vector coordinates. If a DataFrame, rows represent directions
            and columns represent dimension names.
        dimensions : dict
            A dictionary representing the dimensions of the low-dimensional space.
            The keys are user-defined names for the dimensions (matching those in the
            `directions` argument), and the values are dictionaries with the same
            structure as the `weights` argument in `optimize_mga`.
        snapshots : Sequence | None, optional
            Set of snapshots to consider in the optimization. If None, uses all
            snapshots from the network. Defaults to None.
        multi_investment_periods : bool, default False
            Whether to optimize as a single investment period or to optimize in
            multiple investment periods. Then, snapshots should be a ``pd.MultiIndex``.
        slack : float
            Cost slack for budget constraint. Defaults to 0.05.
        model_kwargs: dict
            Keyword arguments used by `linopy.Model`, such as `solver_dir` or
            `chunk`.
        max_parallel : int
            Maximum number of parallel processes to use for solving multiple directions.
            Defaults to 4.
        **kwargs:
            Keyword argument used by `linopy.Model.solve`, such as `solver_name`,

        Returns
        -------
        directions_df : pd.DataFrame
            DataFrame containing the successfully solved directions, where each row
            represents a direction and columns correspond to dimension names.
        coordinates_df : pd.DataFrame
            DataFrame containing the coordinates of each successfully solved network
            in the user-defined dimensions. Rows correspond to solved directions
            and columns to dimension names.

        --------
