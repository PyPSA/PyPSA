        """Add new components.

        Handles addition of single and multiple components along with their attributes.
        Pass a list of names to add multiple components at once or pass a single name
        to add a single component.

        When a single component is added, all non-scalar attributes are assumed to be
        time-varying and indexed by snapshots.
        When multiple components are added, all non-scalar attributes are assumed to be
        static and indexed by names. A single value sequence is treated as scalar and
        broadcasted to all components. It is recommended to explicitly pass a scalar
        instead.
        If you want to add time-varying attributes to multiple components, you can pass
        a 2D array/ DataFrame where the first dimension is snapshots and the second
        dimension is names.

        Any attributes which are not specified will be given the default
        value from :doc:`/user-guide/components`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str or int or list of str or list of int
            Component name(s)
        suffix : str, default ""
            All components are named after name with this added suffix.
        overwrite : bool, default False
            If True, existing components with the same names as in `name` will be
            overwritten. Otherwise only new components will be added and others will be
            ignored.
        kwargs : Any
            Component attributes, e.g. x=[0.1, 0.2], can be list, pandas.Series
            of pandas.DataFrame for time-varying

        Returns
        -------
        new_names : pandas.index
            Names of new components (including suffix)

        Examples
        --------
        The example is shown for Generator component, but the same applies to all
        component types.

        >>> n = pypsa.Network()
        >>> c = n.components.generators
        >>> c
        Empty 'Generator' Components

        Add a single component:

        >>> c.add("my-generator-1", carrier="AC")

        A new generator is added to the components instance:
        >>> c
        'Generator' Components
        ----------------------
        Attached to PyPSA Network 'Unnamed Network'
        Components: 1

        With static data (and default values for all attributes):
        >>> c.static[["carrier", "p_nom"]]
                       carrier  p_nom
        name
        my-generator-1      AC    0.0

        Add multiple components with static attributes:

        >>> c.add(["my-generator-2", "my-generator-3"],
        ...       carrier=["AC", "DC"],
        ...       p_nom=10)

        A new generator is added to the components instance:
        >>> c
        'Generator' Components
        ----------------------
        Attached to PyPSA Network 'Unnamed Network'
        Components: 3

        With static data:
        >>> c.static[["carrier", "p_nom"]]
                   carrier  p_nom
        name
        my-generator-1      AC    0.0
        my-generator-2      AC   10.0
        my-generator-3      DC   10.0

        The single value for `p_nom` is broadcasted to all components. So you could also
        pass `[10, 10]` instead of `10`.
