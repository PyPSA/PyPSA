    "# Implementing balancing power constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this example, we will implement balancing power constraints in PyPSA in a simplified manner. The objective is to enforce some generators to provide balanacing power by running below their nominal capacity but still keep a linear programming problem formulation. \n",

    "\n",
    "To do so, we need to implement additional variables and additional constraints to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We follow the approach that has been presented by Andreas HÃ¶sl et al here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmwDxNpSMM4&t=8043s\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that each generator needs to provide reserve capacity **symmetrically**. That means it needs to be able to increase and decrease its output by the same amount in order to contribute to satisfy reserve requirements. This ensures that generators need to operate at partial load in order to provide reserve capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following modifications need to be added to the linopy model in a PyPSA Network:\n",

    "\n",
    "- a new variable $p_{\\text{reserve}}(g,t)$ that represents the reserve power provided by generator $g$ in time step $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- a constraint that ensures that for each time step $t$, the sum of all reserve power provided is greater or equal the required reserves.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall t: \\sum_{g} p_{\\text{reserve}}(g,t) \\geq \\text{reserve requirement}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- a constraint to ensure that the reserve power a generator provides must be less or equal than the difference between its output $p$ and its nominal capacity $p_\\text{nom}$, multiplied with a scalar coefficient $a$. This coefficient can have any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide balancing power. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall g, t: p_\\text{reserve}(g, t) \\leq a(g) p_\\text{nom}(g) - p(g,t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- a constraint  to ensure that the balancing power a generator provides must be less or equal than its actual output $p$, multiplied with a scalar coefficient $b$. This coefficient can have any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide balancing power. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall g, t: p_\\text{reserve}(g, t) \\leq b(g) p(g,t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between the variables $a$, $b$, $p_\\text{nom}$, $p$, and $p_\\text{reserve}$ are depicted in the following schematic graph.\n",

    "## Limitations and other approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a highly simplified approach that has significant limitations:\n",
    "- It does not distinguish between different categories of reserve power (primary, secondary and xx reserves). \n",
    "- Reserves are provided symmetrical; there is no distinction between positive and negative reserves\n",
    "- The approach only takes into account the provision of balancing power, but not the actual call for balancing power\n",
    "\n",
    "All these issues can be taken into account in a MIP unit commitment model, albeit at much higher numerical costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that reserve margin constraints have been added to PyPSA-EUR: https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/662492a23e4b0fe84f8d65611aad6668488aa88c/scripts/solve_network.py#L393-L472\n",
