    "# Implementing spinning reserve constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a linear programming approach in an energy system, the optimization usually results in all generators either running at full capacity or not running at all, depending on their position in the merit order.\n",
    "In the real world, generators often run at partial load.\n",
    "Unfortunately, most of the reasons why generators run at partial load are difficult to account for in modeling.\n",
    "One reason for generators to run at partial load is to be able to act as spinning reserves, i.e. to be able to ramp up or down quickly when needed to maintain system stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will implement spinning reserve constraints in PyPSA in a very simplified way.\n",
    "The objective is to force some generators to provide reserve power by running below their rated capacity, but still maintain a linear programming problem formulation. \n",
    "To do this, we need to implement additional variables and additional constraints in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution of this example has been funded as part of the IND-E project.\n",
    "\n",
    "![reserve-power-funding](../../doc/img/reserve-power-funding.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We follow the approach presented by Andreas Hösl et al here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmwDxNpSMM4&t=8043s\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that each generator must provide reserve power **symmetrically**. This means that it must be able to increase and decrease its output by the same amount in order to contribute to meeting reserve requirements. This ensures that generators must operate at partial load to provide reserve power. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following changes need to be made to the linopy model in a PyPSA network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a new variable $p_{\\text{reserve}}(g,t)$ representing the reserve power provided by generator $g$ at time step $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- a constraint that ensures that for each time step $t$, the sum of all reserve power provided is greater than or equal to the required reserves.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall t: \\sum_{g} p_{\\text{reserve}}(g,t) \\geq \\text{reserve requirement}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- A constraint to ensure that the reserve power of a generator is less than or equal to the difference between its power $p$ and its nominal power $p_\\text{nom}$, multiplied by a scalar coefficient $a$. This coefficient can take any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide reserve power. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall g, t: p_\\text{reserve}(g, t) \\leq a(g) p_\\text{nom}(g) - p(g,t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- a constraint to ensure that the reserve power of a generator is less than or equal to its actual power $p$ multiplied by a scalar coefficient $b$. This coefficient can take any value between 0 and 1 and represents the technical availability of a generator to provide reserve power. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall g, t: p_\\text{reserve}(g, t) \\leq b(g) p(g,t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships between the variables $a$, $b$, $p_\\text{nom}$, $p$ and $p_\\text{reserve}$ are shown in the following schematic diagram.\n",

    "## Limitations and other approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is an oversimplified approach that has significant limitations:\n",
    "- It does not distinguish between different categories of reserves, such as primary or secondary reserves. \n",
    "- Reserves are provided symmetrically; there is no distinction between positive and negative reserves.\n",
    "- The approach only considers the provision of reserve power, not the actual delivery.\n",
    "  The additional constraints simply force some generators to run at partial load so that they **could** ramp up or down when reserves are required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these issues can be addressed in a MIP unit commitment model, albeit at a much higher numerical cost. \n",
